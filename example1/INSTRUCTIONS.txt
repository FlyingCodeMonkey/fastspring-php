Full instructions to use this example php application. Follow these step by step. It took me quite a bit of debugging to fix the code and get this thing working.

1. Decide where you will host this demo. Don't upload it yet, but note the location. Example: http://www.yoursite.com/fastspring-php

2. If you haven't already, set up an API user account within springboard. After you create the acct, double check that the user has API access. For me, I had to go in a second time and enable API access for the account.

3. Make sure you have a subscription product set up in springboard.

4. Edit lines 5 and 7 of 'example1/include.php' with the values from Steps 2 and 3.

5. Set up a notification in springboard for Subscription Activated Notification. Use NAME/VALUE parameters and point the live server URL to the URL of the 'example1/activate.php' file. Example: http://www.yoursite.com/fastspring-php/example1/activate.php

6. On the Security tab of the Subscription Activated Notification, grab the private key and edit line 4 of 'example1/activate.php'

7. On the HTTP parameters tab of the Subscription Activated Notification, set up two Name/Value parameters. The first 'name' is "customer_ref" and corresponding value "#{subscription.referrer}". The second 'name' is "subscription_ref" and corresponding value "#{subscription.reference}". Do not use the quotes when putting in these entries. These values are passed to and grabbed at lines 9-10 in 'activate.php'

8. Same as Step 5, but for Subscription DEACTIVATED Notification. Point to the 'example1/deactivate.php' url. Example: http://www.yoursite.com/fastspring-php/example1/deactivate.php

9. Same as Step 6, but for Subscription DEACTIVATED Notification. Edit the private key in 'example1/deactivate.php'

10. Same as Step 7, but for Subscription DEACTIVATED Notification. Only one Name/Value parameter is needed: customer_ref / #{subscription.referrer}

11. Upload the full directory to your website at http://www.yoursite.com/fastspring-php

12. Ensure that the http://www.yoursite.com/fastspring-php/example1/tmpcustomers/ directory has write access. I just set it to 777 

13. By default, line 8 of 'example1/include.php' leaves test mode ON, so that you can create test orders. Important: fastpsring stores are VERY sensitive to webbrowser cache. To proceed, clear your browser cache, close your browser, and restart it to make sure we use test mode.

14. Navigate to http://www.yoursite.com/fastspring-php/example1/index.php

15. Click the link for 'Subscription Page' on the left. Since this is your first time, it should take you to fastspring checkout. If you can choose a "test payment" method by giving your springboard user/pass, then test mode is correctly enabled. If you don't see this payment option, then you are not in test mode and might want to re-do Step 13.

16. Once order is complete, revisit http://www.yoursite.com/fastspring-php/example1/index.php

17. Again click on the 'Subscription Page' link on the left. This should now bring you do the demo management page.

18. If instead you are taken back to your checkout, it means that something went wrong with the Subscription Activation Notification. Check that 'example1/tmpcustomers/1.txt' was created on your webserver. If it wasn't created, then your Subscription Activation Notification is either pointing to the wrong URL or the name/value parameters aren't correct.
